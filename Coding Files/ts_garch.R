# defaults to ARFIMA model - sstd model
# beta1 - % from yesterday to today
# beta2 - % from two days ago to today
# Second term in sGARCH to increase beta,first term to increase alpha
# robust standard errors - heteroskedasticity - standard errors actually wrong.
# decide which term to keep - beta2 doesn't have good p-value.

# plot modelfit 
#1.blue - data, red-  conditional sd
#4.there is something in the return but not significant
#5.there are some dynamic in the square - volatility modelling that we prefer
#11. Whether the model works or not - if it works, will look like white noise

#Not needed:
# 9 - confirms that everything is normally distributed.  - 1 to 1 - consistent with normal. 
# near the tails - not so good - but doesn't matter since u only need Â±3

# Forecast

#forecast - out of sample - specify rolling window average(n.roll) - volatility - noisy - smoothing using rolling window - everything turned off except for n.ahead
# take entire data, forecast out of sample
plot(modelfor) #only have default unconditional forecast - sigma prediction - model for data + model for volatility
#1.zoom in to the data - suggest a slight increase
#3. what's gonna happen for volatility - forecasting first a decrease follow by an increase
# trading on volatility - trade on that point - rely on volatility to increase.
